              <p class="about-text">Domenic Cicchetti, has worked in the music industry for more than twenty five years as a performing musician, recording artist, composer, educational clinician, and musical instruments product specialist. After studying at Berklee College of Music, during which time he took private lessons with the famed piano teacher Madam Charloff, Domenic launched his recording career with the 1979 release of “Sunrise” on the Arista record label. He has a book published with Alfred Publishing entitled “Memories of Places and Times”, and his most recent recording “Open Road”, is a collection of original compositions he considers somewhat of an homage to such influential artists as Bill Evans, Chick Corea & Herbie Hancock.</p>
